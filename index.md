### Welcome to myddleton-grange

Welcome to the community website for Myddleton Grange

### Mailing list

I've set up a mailing list for leaseholders here: [https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/myddleton-grange-leaseholders-mailing-list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/myddleton-grange-leaseholders-mailing-list)

I await the list of emails of those who have consented to be on the list from APT.

### Resident packs and other useful information

I await resident packs from APT.

### Next AGM

On May 20th 2019 APT advised that there would not be a next AGM because this is not a requirement of companies house and not having one will allow us to avoid unecessary admin.  

Myddleton Grange Members Meeting â€“ Wednesday 5th June 7:30pm, Myddleton Grange Community Centre, 108 Colthurst Crescent, London N4 2FD
